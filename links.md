This site shows several ways to redirect the echo output into a file. Filled with step-by-step instructions on how to replace the content of a file, append text to an existing file, and echo text to a file on a remote system by SSH.

2. [Echo Command in Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/echo-command-in-linux-with-examples/)<br>
The echo command in linux is used to display line of text/string that are passed as an argument. This is a built in command that is mostly used in shell scripts and batch files to output status text to the screen or a file. This site will show you how to use the echo command with examples.

## WEEK 02
1. [How to Delete GPG Keys in Linux](https://linuxhint.com/delete-gpg-keys-linux/)<br>
Not only this site explains how to delete revoked, unsigned, and expired keys, it also shows us types of GPG keys along with the difference between them. Very easy to understand as it is also filled with examples.

## WEEK 03
1. [Linux Regular Expressions](https://www.guru99.com/linux-regular-expressions.html)<br>
Linux Regular Expressions are special characters which help search data and matching complex patterns. Regular expressions are shortened as ‘regexp’ or ‘regex’. They are used in many Linux programs like grep, bash, rename, sed, etc.

2. [How to Use Regular Expressions (RegEx) on Linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-regular-expressions-regex-on-linux/)<br>
Regexps are acronyms for regular expressions. Regular expressions are special characters or sets of characters that help us to search for data and match the complex pattern. Regexps are most commonly used with the Linux commands:- grep, sed, tr, vi.

## WEEK 04
1. [Learn C Programming](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming)<br>
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.

2. [C Programming Language Tutorial](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-programming-language-tutorial)<br>
C language Tutorial with programming approach for beginners and professionals, helps you to understand the C language tutorial easily. This tutorial explains each topic with programs.

3. [C Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/c/)<br>
C is a general-purpose programming language, developed in 1972, and still quite popular. C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc.

## WEEK 05
1. [Little and Big Endian Mystery](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/little-and-big-endian-mystery/)<br>
Little and big endian are two ways of storing multibyte data-types ( int, float, etc). In little endian machines, last byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first. On the other hand, in big endian machines, first byte of binary representation of the multibyte data-type is stored first.

2. [Virtual Memory in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)<br>
Virtual Memory is a storage allocation scheme in which secondary memory can be addressed as though it were part of the main memory. The addresses a program may use to reference memory are distinguished from the addresses the memory system uses to identify physical storage sites, and program-generated addresses are translated automatically to the corresponding machine addresses.

3. [Operating System - Virtual Memory](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system. This extra memory is actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM.

## WEEK 06
1. [Concurrency in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/concurrency-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Concurrency%20is%20the%20execution%20of,shared%20memory%20or%20message%20passing.)<br>
This site explains concurrency as the execution of the multiple instruction sequences at the same time. Very precise and easy to understand.

2. [Process Synchronization in OS](https://www.scaler.com/topics/operating-system/process-synchronization-in-os/)<br>
This site explains process synchronization as the way by which processes that share the same memory space are managed in an operating system. In which it helps to maintain the consistency of data by using variables or hardware so that only one process can make changes to the shared memory at a time.

## WEEK 07
1. [Introduction of Deadlock in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)<br>
Deadlock is a situation where a set of processes are blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process. This site explains it all.

2. [Various Synchronization](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-synchronization-introduction)<br>
The procedure involved in preserving the appropriate order of execution of cooperative processes is known as Process Synchronization. There are various synchronization mechanisms that are used to synchronize the processes. This site explains it all.

## WEEK 08
1. [Ways to Fix “No Space Left on Device” Error in Linux](https://helpdeskgeek.com/linux-tips/top-3-ways-to-fix-no-space-left-on-device-error-in-linux/#:~:text=The%20most%20probable%20cause%20of,the%20lsof%20and%20grep%20commands.)<br>
Getting a “No place left on device error” explains very little. Why is this error message showing up? Why can’t you create new files despite having sufficient space on the disk? And most importantly, how do you fix it?

2. [g++ fatal error: killed signal terminated program cc1plus](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66967848/g-fatal-error-killed-signal-terminated-program-cc1plus-when-trying-to-install)<br>
Have you ever gotten this error? This site is for you.
